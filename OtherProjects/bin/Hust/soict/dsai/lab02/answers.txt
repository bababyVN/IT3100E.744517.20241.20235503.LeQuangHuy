Lab02: No. If we create 2 Constructor: + DigitalVideoDisc(title : String) and + DigitalVideoDisc( category : String), then Java can not distinguish between the twos since both has the same number of parameters and type.
But we can work around this by using for example: + DigitalVideoDisc(title : String) and + DigitalVideoDisc( category : String, isCategory : boolean).
